# Biometric Authentication

This project about a biometric authentication scheme using Java language without using any library routines. The authentication system based on image processing with Java Abstract Window Toolkit [(AWT)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/package-summary.html#package_description). The system takes two image inputs for authentication. That two images should more similar (capture without moving) but one open eye photo and other one is closed eye photo. Mainly the system considers four factors. First, how many pixels covered by the black area of the eye and next how many pixels covered by the white area of the eye. The third factor is the symmetric factor. The last factor is approximate face height and width. These all factors stored in a database as a weighted ratio. However, the system cannot identify face when high brightness or more dark background. So, very low resolution images and large background with the small face images are very poor in identify.
